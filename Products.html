                <img src="" alt="">
                    <p>This parachute is designed for ultimate pace.
                        <br> It opens right when you hit the ground automatically, 
                        removing any need to open it manually while airborne.
                        <br> Also it significantly reduces the time you spend while falling, 
                        helping you to get to your target in fastest means possible.

                    <p>Have you ever wondered about the time you spend while turning or pushing the door know to open the door?
                       We did! 
                       <br> Now with DoorNOb, you don't even have to touch your hand to the doorkNOb itself to open your doors!
                       <br> Instead, contrary to standart, traditional, old and boring doorknobs, doorNOb sensors senses your hands and opens the door automatically.
                       Brilliant! Right?

                <img src="" alt="">
                    <p>This brand new innovation removes the need for toilet papers for good!
                        <br>Infinite Toilet Paper has over a billion plies!
                        <br>We haven't thought much about this product. Just added more plies.
                        <br> But it works! I haven't replenished my toilet paper cabinet in a year!
                        <br>You need more space though.
